# DSA Through Stories 🧠📖

Many people don’t hate Data Structures & Algorithms.  
They hate **how it is taught**.

This repository explains popular DSA patterns using **real-world stories**
before introducing intuition, pseudocode, and finally code.

If algorithms ever felt:
- overwhelming
- magical
- memorization-heavy

this repo is for you.
