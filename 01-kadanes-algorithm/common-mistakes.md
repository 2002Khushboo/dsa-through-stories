## Common Mistakes

❌ Thinking Kadane finds non-contiguous elements  
✔️ It ONLY works on continuous subarrays

❌ Using sliding window logic  
✔️ There is no shrinking here — only reset

❌ Initializing max sum to 0  
✔️ Fails for arrays with all negative numbers

❌ Memorizing formula without intuition  
✔️ Leads to confusion in variations
