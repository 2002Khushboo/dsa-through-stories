## Story 1: Daily Mood Tracker 🙂

Each day affects your mood:
- Positive number → good day
- Negative number → bad day

You want to find the **best continuous phase of life**.

If yesterday made you miserable enough to ruin today,
you emotionally “start fresh” today.

That’s Kadane.

## Story 2: Business Profit & Loss 💼

Each day:
- +ve → profit
- -ve → loss

You want the **most profitable continuous period**.

If your losses so far exceed today’s profit,
it’s better to **close shop and restart** today.

## Story 3: Road Trip Energy 🚗

Each stretch of road:
- uphill → drains energy
- downhill → gives energy

You want the **most energizing continuous stretch**.

If you’re exhausted before a segment,
you stop counting earlier fatigue and restart.

## Story 4: Studying Focus 📚

Each hour of study:
- productive → +focus
- distracted → -focus

You want the **best continuous study session**.

If your focus is already negative,
continuing makes no sense — start fresh.

## Story 5: Battery Charging 🔋

Each app interaction:
- consumes or adds charge

You want the **maximum charge gained continuously**.

If battery is already negative,
plugging earlier drains is pointless.
