# Contributing to DSA Through Stories 💛

Thank you for wanting to contribute!

This repository is **not about clever code**.
It is about **clear intuition**.

## ✨ What we value

✅ Beginner-first explanations  
✅ Real-world stories  
✅ Honest confusion → clarity  
✅ Simple language over jargon  

---

## 🚫 What to avoid

❌ “This is trivial”  
❌ Pure math without intuition  
❌ Code without explanation  
❌ Showing off

## 🧱 How to add a new topic

1. Create a new folder like:
   03-two-pointers/

2. Include these files:
- stories.md (minimum 3 stories)
- intuition.md
- pattern.md
- common-mistakes.md
- pseudocode.md
- code.(any language)

3. Start with **stories**, not code.

## ✍️ Writing style

- Assume the reader is confused
- Explain *why*, not just *what*
- If something confused you — say so

> “This didn’t make sense to me at first, until…”

That sentence is always welcome here.
