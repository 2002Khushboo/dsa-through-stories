## The Core Intuition

Two Pointers is used when:

✅ Data is sorted (or can be sorted)
✅ You are comparing pairs / ends / ranges
✅ Moving one side gives predictable effect

You always ask:

“Which side is causing the problem?”

And move only that pointer.

## 🧩 HOW TO DECIDE: TWO POINTERS vs SLIDING WINDOW

Ask ONE question:

👉 Does removing from ONE SIDE fix the problem?

YES → Sliding Window

NO, depends on BOTH ENDS → Two Pointers

That’s the separator.
